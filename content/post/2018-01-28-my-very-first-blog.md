Thanks [Yihui](https://yihui.name) for inviting me to help him mantaining the [DT](https://github.com/rstudio/DT) package. Though we've never met in person before ^[In fact, I met him once in 2016 on an R meeting in Beijing but didn't start a conversation because he had talked himself hoarse.], I was thrilled and replied "Yes" immediately. 

After submitting my first [PR](https://github.com/rstudio/DT/pull/475) to **DT**, I felt excited and decided to crack another hard nut, which is a two-year old bug about Chinese encoding in [data.table](https://github.com/Rdatatable/data.table). Luckily, [succeeded](https://github.com/Rdatatable/data.table/pull/2566) again and it gives me the impetus to re-open my blog.
